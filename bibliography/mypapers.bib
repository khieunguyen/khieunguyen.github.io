  Abstract                 = {Diffusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (DfMRI) has been proposed as a method for functional neuroimaging studies, as an alternative to blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)-fMRI. DfMRI is thought to more directly reflect neural activation, but its exact mechanism remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that the water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) decrease observed upon neural activation results from swelling of neurons or neuron parts. To elucidate the origin of the DfMRI response at cellular level we performed diffusion MR microscopy at 17.2 T in Aplysia californica buccal ganglia and compared the water ADCs at cellular and ganglia levels before and after neuronal activation induced by perfusion with a solution containing dopamine. Neural cell swelling, evidenced from optical microscopy imaging, resulted in an intracellular ADC increase and an ADC decrease at ganglia level. Furthermore, the intracellular ADC increase was found to have a significant positive correlation with the increase in cell size. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that the ADC decrease observed with DfMRI upon neuronal activation at tissue level reflects activation-induced neural cell swelling.},

  Abstract                 = {The primary goal of this work is to develop an efficient Monte-Carlo simulation of diffusion-weighted signal in complex cellular structures, such as astrocytes, directly derived from confocal microscopy. In this study, we first use an octree structure for spatial decomposition of surface meshes. Octree structure and radius-search algorithm help to quickly identify the faces that particles can possibly encounter during the next time step, thus speeding up the Monte-Carlo simulation. Furthermore, we propose to use a three-dimensional binary marker to describe the complex cellular structure and optimize the particle trajectory simulation. Finally, a GPU-based version of these two approaches is implemented for more efficient modeling. It is shown that the GPU-based binary marker approach yields unparalleled performance, opening up new possibilities to better understand intracellular diffusion, validate diffusion models, and create dictionaries of intracellular diffusion signatures.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work we present the implementation of compressed sensing (CS) on a high field preclinical scanner (17.2T) using an undersampling trajectory based on the diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) random growth model. When applied to a library of images this approach performs better than the traditional undersampling based on the polynomial probability density function. In addition, we show that the method is applicable to imaging live neuronal tissues, allowing significantly shorter acquisition times while maintaining the image quality necessary for identifying the majority of neurons via an automatic cell segmentation algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {High resolution Manganese Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MEMRI), which uses manganese as a T1 contrast agent, has great potential for functional imaging of live neuronal tissue at single neuron scale. However, reaching high resolutions often requires long acquisition times which can lead to reduced image quality due to sample deterioration and hardware instability. Compressed Sensing (CS) techniques offer the opportunity to significantly reduce the imaging time. The purpose of this work is to test the feasibility of CS acquisitions based on Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) sampling patterns for high resolution quantitative T1-weighted imaging. Fully encoded and DLA-CS T1-weighted images of Aplysia californica neural tissue were acquired on a 17.2T MRI system. The MR signal corresponding to single, identified neurons was quantified for both versions of the T1 weighted images. For a 50% undersampling, DLA-CS can accurately quantify signal intensities in T1-weighted acquisitions leading to only 1.37% differences when compared to the fully encoded data, with minimal impact on image spatial resolution. In addition, we compared the conventional polynomial undersampling scheme with the DLA and showed that, for the data at hand, the latter performs better. Depending on the image signal to noise ratio, higher undersampling ratios can be used to further reduce the acquisition time in MEMRI based functional studies of living tissues.},
